### About

This is a randomizer for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (North American Gamecube version).
It randomizes all the items in the game so that each playthrough is unique and you never know where a particular item will be.
It also makes the game completely open world from the start, and removes most cutscenes from the game.

### Information

Every playthrough should be completable, and you don't need to use any glitches or tricks to beat it.

If you seem to be stuck and can't find anywhere to progress, you should first consult the spoiler log. The spoiler log is generated at the same time as the randomized ISO, and is put in the same folder. It contains information on everything that was randomized in this seed, and lists the order you can get progress items in as well.

If you've consulted the spoiler log and you're still stuck, it's possible you've encountered a bug in the randomizer.
Please report bugs like that here: https://github.com/LagoLunatic/wwrando/issues
In the bug report be sure to upload your spoiler log (or at least copy paste the part at the top with the version number, seed, and options).
