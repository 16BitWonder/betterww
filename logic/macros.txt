Can Get Inside Forsaken Fortress:
  Can Get Past Forsaken Fortress Gate & Skull Hammer
  # Even though you can kill Phantom Ganon without the Skull Hammer, that only lets you access the one chest he spawns.

  # Note that his energy balls can be reflected with either the Master Sword or an empty bottle, but you still need the Master Sword to deal damage.
