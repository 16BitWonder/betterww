Better Wind Waker  

This is an ISO patcher for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker based on [LagoLunatic's wwrando](https://github.com/LagoLunatic/wwrando).

**This adds features from the Wind Waker Randomizer to an ISO without randomization.**  
Intended to make a more enjoyable casual experience reflecting many quality of life changes made for Wind Waker HD.

**Custom Player Models**  

Allows you to customize Link, but "casual" outfits will only be seen before getting the tunic or during New Game+  
  
Models can be found on [the github repository](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models), on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/6173), or the [ WW Randomizer Discord](https://discord.gg/r2963mt)  
Add them to the models folder.

### Other Tweaks
  
You can apply the [Widescreen Patch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5huyf6r3drynq1c/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20The%20Wind%20Waker%20Widescreen.zip?dl=1) before running this  

You can apply the [Female Pronoun Patch](http://slothsoft.tumblr.com/post/36097890951/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-pronoun) before running this  

If using Dolphin you can use [Hypatia's HD Texture Pack](https://onthegreatsea.tumblr.com/DOWNLOADS)

**Gecko codes you may want to use (by Ralf and wiiztec)**  
Included is an optional file with these Gecko codes that I like to use:  
  
* Second set of equipped items (D-pad down to switch)   
* Hero Mode (Take double damage, no heart drops)  
* Items don't disappear  
* Unrestricted Camera  
* No Heart Beeping Noise  
* Blur off
