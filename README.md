Better Wind Waker  

This is an ISO patcher for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker based on [LagoLunatic's wwrando](https://github.com/LagoLunatic/wwrando).

**This adds features from the Wind Waker Randomizer to an ISO without randomization.**  
Intended to make a more enjoyable casual experience reflecting many quality of life changes made for Wind Waker HD.  

*The download button above is for source code, not the application.*  
**[Download the program here](https://github.com/WideBoner/betterww/releases)**  

You can toggle the following on/off:
* Swift Sail replaces Sail  
* Brisk Sail (faster swift sail)
* Instant text boxes  
* Faster block moving  
* Faster grapple hook  
* Faster rolling speed  
* Faster crawling, climbing, NPC chat zoom  
* Tingle chests without tingle tuner 
* Turn while swinging or grappling
* Faster ballad of gales  
* No song replays  
* Remove intro video  
* Invert camera  
* Unrestricted boat  
* Reveal full sea chart 
* Random Enemy Colors  


**Custom Player Models**  

Allows you to customize Link, but "casual" outfits will only be seen before getting the tunic or if playing Second Quest

Models can be found on [the github repository](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models), on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/6173), or the [ WW Randomizer Discord](https://discord.gg/r2963mt)  
Add them to the models folder.  


### Other Tweaks

You can apply the [Widescreen Patch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5huyf6r3drynq1c/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20The%20Wind%20Waker%20Widescreen.zip?dl=1) before using this  

You can apply the [Gender neutral](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2906/) or [Female](https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/11342) pronoun patch to match your customization before using this  

If using Dolphin you can use [Hypatia's HD Texture Pack](https://onthegreatsea.tumblr.com/DOWNLOADS)

**Gecko codes you may want to use (by Ralf and wiiztec)**  
Included is an optional file with these Gecko codes that I like to use:  

* Second set of equipped items (D-pad down to switch)   
* Hero Mode (Take double damage, no heart drops)  
* Items don't disappear  
* Unrestricted Camera  
* No Heart Beeping Noise  
* Blur off  

### Download

### Information

This program only supports the North American Gamecube version of Wind Waker. (MD5: d8e4d45af2032a081a0f446384e9261b)  
In addition, follow this if you want to use PyInstaller to build a distributable version of the randomizer:  

This works on Gamecube/Wii/Dolphin.
The European and Japanese versions of Wind Waker won't work, and neither will Wind Waker HD.
